* From NSData to Data in Swift 3

Swift 3 encompasses many different small and big changes to the language. One of them is the introduction of value type wrappers for common Foundation reference types such as NSData (=Data=) or NSDate (=Date=). These new types differ not only in their memory behaviour and name, their methods also differ from their reference-based counterparts[fn:: Some, such as =Date= aren't even wrappers but completely new implementations]. From small changes to new method names up to big changes like completely removed functionalities, these new value types require some getting used to. This post will try to highlight some of the bigger changes happened to =Data= the value-based wrapper for =NSData=.

Even better, after going through the basics, we will write a small example application that will read and parse a Doom [fn:: Doom1, Doom2, Hexen, Heretic, or Ultimate Doom. Though I've only tested it with Doom1 Shareware] WAD file.

* Basic Differences

One of the most common usage scenarios for =NSData= is the loading and writing of data via these calls:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
func writeToURL(_ url: NSURL, atomically atomically: Bool) -> Bool
func writeToURL(_ url: NSURL, options writeOptionsMask: NSDataWritingOptions) throws
// ... (implementations for file: String instead of NSURL)
init?(contentsOfURL url: NSURL)
init(contentsOfURL url: NSURL, options readOptionsMask: NSDataReadingOptions) throws
// ... (implementations for file: String instead of NSURL)
#+END_SRC

For those basic usages, very little changed. The new =Data= type offers these methods:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
init(contentsOf: URL, options: ReadingOptions)
func write(to: URL, options: WritingOptions)
#+END_SRC

Note that =Data= simplifies the various ways of reading and writing data from the file system into two calls while =NSData= offers multiple different methods.

Another difference can be observed when comparing the methods on =NSData= with those on =Data=. While =NSData= offers 30 methods & properties, =Data= offers 130. This huge difference is easily explained via Swift's formidable Protocol Extensions. =Data= obtains many of those methods from the following protocols:

- CustomStringConvertible
- Equatable
- Hashable
- MutableCollection
- RandomAccessCollection
- RangeReplaceableCollection
- ReferenceConvertible

This adds functionality to =Data= which did not exist in =NSData=. Here's a small sample:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
func distance(from: Int, to: Int)
func dropFirst(Int)
func dropLast(Int)
func filter((UInt8) -> Bool)
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((UInt8) -> ElementOfResult?)
func forEach((UInt8) -> Void)
func index(Int, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Int)
func map<T>((UInt8) -> T)
func max()
func min()
func partition()
func prefix(Int)
func reversed()
func sort()
func sorted()
func split(separator: UInt8, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool)
func reduce<Result>(Result, (partialResult: Result, UInt8) -> Result)
#+END_SRC

As you can see, many functional approaches, such as mapping or filtering can now be done on the byte contents of =Data= types. This, to me, is a huge improvement over =NSData=. An example of the benefits this brings is how easily you can now subscript and compare data:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
var data = Data(bytes: [0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03])  
print(data[2]) // 2
data[2] = 0x09
print (data == Data(bytes: [0x00, 0x01, 0x09, 0x03])) // true  
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2
: true

=Data= also offers several new initializers which specifically handle other common Swift data types:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
init(bytes: Array<UInt8>)
init<SourceType>(buffer: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<SourceType>)
init(repeating: UInt8, count: Int)
#+END_SRC

* GetBytes

Another difference which you will run into if you're using =Data= to interact with lower level code such as =C= libraries is the distinct lack of the =NSData= =getBytes= method:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
// NSData
func getBytes(_ buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer<Void>, length length: Int)
#+END_SRC

There're many different usage scenarious for =getBytes=. One of the most common is when you need to parse a file and read the bytes into data types / variables. A common example: Say you want to read a binary file which encodes a list of items. The file is encoded as follows:

| Datatype | Size | Function        |
|----------+------+-----------------|
| Char     |    4 | Header (ABCD)   |
| UInt32   |    4 | Start of Data   |
| UInt32   |    4 | Amount of items |

The file contains a 4 byte string "ABCD" tagging it as the correct file type. The next 4 bytes define the start of the actual data (i.e. where the header ends and the items begin), the final 4 bytes in the header define the amount of items stored in this file.

Parsing this data with =NSData= is pretty straight forward:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let data = ...
var length: UInt32 = 0
var start: UInt32 = 0
data.getBytes(&start, range: NSRange(location: 4, length: 4))
data.getBytes(&length, range: NSRange(location: 8, length: 4))
#+END_SRC

This will return the correct result[fn:: Note we did not make sure that this is indeed an ABCD file by testing for the first 4 bytes, but that would be easy to add]. If your data does not contain C strings, there's an even easier way of doing this, you can simply define a =struct= with the correct fields and read the bytes directly into the struct:

| Datatype | Size | Function        |
|----------+------+-----------------|
| UInt32   |    4 | Start of Data   |
| UInt32   |    4 | Amount of items |

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let data = ...
struct Header { 
  let start: UInt32
  let length: UInt32
}
var header = Header(start: 0, length: 0)
data.getBytes(&header, range: NSRange(location: 0, length: 8))
#+END_SRC

* Data alternatives to =getBytes=

However, if you're using =Data= this functionality is not available anymore. Instead, =Data= offers a new method:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
// Access the bytes in the data.
func withUnsafeBytes<ResultType, ContentType>((UnsafePointer<ContentType>) -> ResultType)
#+END_SRC

This method allows direct access of the our data's bytes from within a closure. Let's see a simple example:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
let data = Data(bytes: [0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
data.withUnsafeBytes { (pointer: UnsafePointer<UInt8>) -> Void in
    print(pointer)
    print(pointer.pointee)
}
// Prints: 
// : 0x00007f8dcb77cc50
// : 1
#+END_SRC

Ok, now that we have an unsafe UInt8 pointer into our data, how does this help us? First of fall, we obviously need a different data type, and we're sure (we have to be!) that the data is indeed of this particular data type. We know that this data contains a Int32 type, so how do we decode it correctly?

As we already have a unsafe pointer (of type UInt8) it is easy to move this into an unsafe pointer of our target type. =UnsafePointer= has a =pointee= property which returns the type that the pointer is pointing to as the correct type:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
let data = Data(bytes: [0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00])
let result = data.withUnsafeBytes { (pointer: UnsafePointer<Int32>) -> Int32 in
      return pointer.pointee
}
print(result)
//: 256
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 256

As you can see, we created a byte =Data= instance, and returned the data as =Int32= by defining an =UnsafePointer<Int32>= in the closure. You can shorten this code if the compiler is able to infer the result type from the context:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let result: Int32 = data.withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
#+END_SRC

* Lifetime of the data

One important consideration of using =withUnsafeBytes= (apart from the fact that the whole operation is unsafe) is that the lifetime of the pointer you're accessing is limited to the lifetime of your closure. As the documentation notes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Warning
The byte pointer argument should not be stored and used outside of the lifetime of the call to the closure.
#+END_QUOTE

* Generic Solution

Now that we have a way of accessing raw bytes and casting them to the correct type, we ought to create a generic solution that allows us to perform this operation easily without the syntactical overhead. Also, we still did not account for the fact that we need to perform the operation on a subsequence of our data and not the whole =Data= instance. A generic solution would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
extension Data {
    func scanValue<T>(start: Int, length: Int) -> T {
        return self.subdata(in: start..<start+length).withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
    }
}
let data = Data(bytes: [0x01, 0x02, 0x01, 0x02])
let a: Int16 = data.scanValue(start: 0, length: 1)
print(a)
// : 1
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2
Compared to our earlier code, this has a couple of notable differences:
- We're using =subdata= to only scan the bytes of a specific slice of our Data. 
- We're using generics to support different possible data types for extraction

* To Data

The opposite case, taking an existing variable and getting a =Data= buffer to the content, is not relevant for the Doom example below, but easy enough to implement:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
var variable = 256
let data = Data(buffer: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: &variable, count: 1))
print(data) // : <00010000 00000000>
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000>

* Parsing the Doom WAD file

I've played a lot of Doom in  my youth. I loved the game. I also created a lot of Doom levels and modified the WAD file to incorporate new sprites, textures, and more. So when I thought about a nice (and simple) example of how to parse a binary file, I remembered the layout of the WAD file which is pretty straightforward and easy to implement. So I wrote a simple app that reads a WAD file and lists the names of all the floor textures stored in the WAD[fn:: I kinda wanted to also display the textures but lacked the time to implement that.].

The source code for this application [[https://github.com/terhechte/SwiftWadReader][is available on Github]].

The Doom WAD file layout is described in these two documents:
- http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/WAD
- http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/hosted/doomspec1666.txt

However, for our simple example, we only need to understand a subset of the format. First, each WAD file begins with a header:

| Datatype | Size | Function                                 |
|----------+------+------------------------------------------|
| Char     |    4 | IWAD or PWAD string                      |
| Int32    |    4 | The number of lumps in the WAD           |
| Int32    |    4 | Pointer to the location of the directory |

The first 4 bytes are spend to identify the file format. =IWAD= are official Doom WAD files, =PWAD= are patches containing additional information patched at runtime into the main WAD file. Our application will only read =IWAD= files. The next 4 bytes define the number of /lumps/ in the WAD. Lumps are the individual items that the Doom engine operates with: Textures, Sprite-Frames, Text blocks, Models, etc. Each texture is a distinct lump. The final 4 bytes define the location of the /directory/. We'll explain the directory below, once we start parsing it. First, lets parse the header.

** Parsing the Header

Reading a WAD file is straight forward:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let data = try Data(contentsOf: wadFileURL, options: .alwaysMapped)
#+END_SRC

Once we have the data, we need to parse the header. We're making heavy use of the =scanValue= =Data= extension we defined earlier.

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
public func validateWadFile() throws {
    // Several Wad File definitions
    let wadMaxSize = 12, wadLumpsStart = 4, wadDirectoryStart = 8, wadDefSize = 4
    // A WAD file always starts with a 12-byte header.
    guard data.count >= wadMaxSize else { throw WadReaderError.invalidWadFile(reason: "File is too small") }

    // It contains three values:

    // The ASCII characters "IWAD" or "PWAD". Defines whether the WAD is an IWAD or a PWAD.
    let validStart = "IWAD".data(using: String.Encoding.ascii)!
    guard data.subdata(in: 0..<wadDefSize) == validStart else
    { throw WadReaderError.invalidWadFile(reason: "Not an IWAD") }

    // An integer specifying the number of lumps in the WAD.
    let lumpsInteger: Int32 = data.scanValue(start: wadLumpsStart, length: wadDefSize)

    // An integer holding a pointer to the location of the directory.
    let directoryInteger: Int32 = data.scanValue(start: wadDirectoryStart, length: wadDefSize)

    guard lumpsInteger > 0 && directoryInteger > Int32(wadMaxSize)
        else {
            throw WadReaderError.invalidWadFile(reason: "Empty Wad File")
    }
}
#+END_SRC

You can find additional types (such as the =WadReaderError= =enum=) in [[https://github.com/terhechte/SwiftWadReader][the source on GitHub]]. The next step is to parse the directory, so that we get the addresses and sizes of the individual lumps.

** Parsing the Directory

The directory associates names of lumps with the data that belong to them. It consists of a number of entries, each with a length of 16 bytes. The length of the directory is determined by the number given in the WAD header.

Each of the 16 bytes entries follows the same format:

| Datatype | Size | Function                                 |
|----------+------+------------------------------------------|
| Int32    |    4 | The start of the lumps data in the file  |
| Int32    |    4 | The size of the lump in bytes            |
| Char     |    8 | An ASCII string defining the lump's name |

The name char is a bit more complicated. The documentation says:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An ASCII string defining the lump's name. Only the characters A-Z (uppercase), 0-9, and [ ] - _ should be used in lump names (an exception has to be made for some of the Arch-Vile sprites, which use "\"). When a string is less than 8 bytes long, it should be null-padded to the tight byte.
#+END_QUOTE

Note the last sentence. In C, a String is terminated with the null character (=\0=). This signifies to the system that the memory for the string ends here. Doom saves space by having an optional null character. When the string is less than 8 bytes long, it will contain a null character, when it is of the max length (8 bytes) the 8th byte will be the final character, not the null character. 

|       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | | |
|-------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|
| Short | I | M | P | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | |
| Long  | F | L | O | O | R | 4 | _ | 5 | | |

See above for an example. The Short name has a null character after the last letter in position 3, the long name does not have a null character, instead the last letter is the *5* from the name *FLOOR4_5*. The =|= signifieds the beginning of the next item / piece of memory.

Before we venture into supporting this, lets first take care of the easier part, reading the start and size.

Before we start, we should define a data structure that can store the information from the directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
public struct Lump {
    public let filepos: Int32
    public let size: Int32
    public let name: String
}
#+END_SRC

Afterwards, we take the slice of data that constitutes our directory from the complete data instance. 

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
// Define the default size of a directory entry
let wadDirectoryEntrySize = 16
// Extract the directory slice from the main Data
let directory = data.subdata(in: Int(directoryLocation)..<(Int(directoryLocation) + Int(numberOfLumps) * wadDirectoryEntrySize))
#+END_SRC

Next, we can iterate over the =Data= in 16byte steps. This works great with Swift's =stride= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
for currentIndex in stride(from: 0, to: directory.count, by: wadDirectoryEntrySize) {
    let currentDirectoryEntry = directory.subdata(in: currentIndex..<currentIndex+wadDirectoryEntrySize)

    // An integer holding a pointer to the start of the lump's data in the file.
    let lumpStart: Int32 = currentDirectoryEntry.scanValue(start: 0, length: 4)

    // An integer representing the size of the lump in bytes.
    let lumpSize: Int32 = currentDirectoryEntry.scanValue(start: 4, length: 4)
    ...
}
#+END_SRC

This was the easier part the next part is a bit more difficult.

** Parsing C Strings

Remember, for each lump's name, we need to stop reading bytes into our Swift string once we reach a null terminator *or* once we reach 8 bytes. The very first thing to do is create a data slice with the relevant data:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let nameData = currentDirectoryEntry.subdata(in: 8..<16)
#+END_SRC

Swift offers great support for C String interoperability. This means that to create a string we just need to hand the data to a =String= initializer:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let lumpName = String(data: nameData, encoding: String.Encoding.ascii)
#+END_SRC

This works, though the result is not correct. This method ignores the null terminator, so that all names, even the short ones, are converted to 8byte strings. As an example, the lump for the *IMP* character name becomes *IMP00000*. This happens because Doom fills the remaining 5 bytes with null characters and =String(data:encoding:)= does not interpret them but creates a string of the full 8 bytes of the =nameData=.

If we want to support null characters, Swift offers something else, a =cString= initializer which is defined for reading valid cStrings with null terminators:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
// Produces a string containing the bytes in a given C array, 
// interpreted according to a given encoding.
init?(cString: UnsafePointer<CChar>, encoding enc: String.Encoding)
#+END_SRC

Note that it doesn't require a =data= instance as its parameter but an unsafePointer to =CChars= instead. We already know how to do that, so lets write the code:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let lumpName2 = nameData.withUnsafeBytes({ (pointer: UnsafePointer<UInt8>) -> String? in
    return String(cString: UnsafePointer<CChar>(pointer), encoding: String.Encoding.ascii)
})
#+END_SRC

This, again, doesn't work. In all cases where Doom's names are less than 8 characters, this code works flawlessly, but once we reach a 8 byte name without a null terminator, it will continue reading (into the next 16byte segment) until it finds the next valid null terminator. This results in long strings with random memory at the end.

Since this logic is custom to Doom, we also need to implement custom code. As =Data= supports Swift's collection & sequence operations, we can just solve this in terms of reduce:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
let lumpName3Bytes = try nameData.reduce([UInt8](), { (a: [UInt8], b: UInt8) throws -> [UInt8] in
    guard b > 0 else { return a }
    guard a.count <= 8 else { return a }
    return a + [b]
})
guard let lumpName3 = String(bytes: lumpName3Bytes, encoding: String.Encoding.ascii)
    else {
        throw WadReaderError.invalidLup(reason: "Could not decode lump name for bytes \(lumpName3Bytes)")
}
#+END_SRC

This code just reduces over the =UInt8= bytes of our data and checks whether we have an early null terminator. This code works, [[https://appventure.me/2015/11/30/reduce-all-the-things/][though it is not necessarily fast as the data has to be moved through several abstractions.]] 

It would be better if we could solve this similarly to how the Doom engine does it. Doom just moves the pointer of the =char*= and checks for each char whether it is a null terminator in order to break early. As Doom is written in low level C code, it can just iterate over the raw pointer addresses.

How would we implement this logic in Swift? We can actually do something quite similar in Swift by, again, utilizing =withUnsafeBytes=. Lets see:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift

let finalLumpName = nameData.withUnsafeBytes({ (pointer: UnsafePointer<CChar>) -> String? in
    var localPointer = pointer
    for _ in 0..<8 {
        guard localPointer.pointee != CChar(0) else { break }
        localPointer = localPointer.successor()
    }
    let position = pointer.distance(to: localPointer)
    return String(data: nameData.subdata(in: 0..<position),
                  encoding: String.Encoding.ascii)
})
guard let lumpName4 = finalLumpName else {
    throw WadReaderError.invalidLup(reason: "Could not decode lump name for bytes \(lumpName3Bytes)")
}
#+END_SRC

Similar to our earlier uses of =withUnsafeBytes= we're receiving a pointer to the raw memory. =pointer= is a =let= constant, but we need to modify the variable, which is why we create a local mutable version in the first line [fn:: Swift 3 dropped support for the useful =var= annotation in closure or function bodies].

Afterwards, we're performing the main work. We loop from 0 to 8 and for each loop iteration we test whether the char that the pointer is pointing to (the =pointee=) is equal to the null terminator (=CChar(0)=). If it is equal to the null terminator, this means that we found the null terminator early, and we break. If it is not equal to the null terminator, we overwrite =localPointer= with its successor, i.e. the next position in memory after the current pointer. That way, we're iterating byte by byte over the contents of our memory.

Once we're done, we calculate the distance between our original =pointer= and our =localPointer=. If we just advanced three times before finding a null terminator, the distance between the two pointers would be 3. This distance, finally, allows us to create a new String instance with the subdata of actual C String.

This allows us to create a new =Lump= struct with the required data:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
lumps.append(Lump(filepos: lumpStart, size: lumpSize, name: lumpName4))                
#+END_SRC

When you look into the source, you will see ominous references to =F_START= and =F_END=. Doom marks the beginning and end of special /lump regions/ with empty lumps with magic names. =F_START / F_END= enclose all the floor texture lumps. We will ignore this additional step in this tutorial.

A screenshot from the final application:

<br/>
<br/>
</div>
#+END_HTML

Not really impressive, I know. One of the next installments on this blog  might concentrate on how to display those textures.

* Bridging to NSData

I find the new =Data= easier to work with than =NSData=. Nevertheless, if you need =NSData= or if you need to use the =getBytes= method, there's an easy way to convert =Data= to =NSData=. The Swift documentation writes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This type provides “copy-on-write” behavior, and is also bridged to the Objective-C NSData class. You can wrap an instance of a custom subclass of NSData in struct Data by converting it using myData as Data.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :prologue "import Foundation"
// Create a new Data Struct
let aDataStruct = Data()
// Get the underlying reference type NSData
let aDataReference = aDataStruct as NSData
#+END_SRC

Whenever you feel that what you're trying to do seems to be really hard with the =Data= type, it is easy to go back to =NSData= to use the well known tried and trusted methods. However, in general you should strive to use the new =Data= type whenever possible (except if you need reference semantics):
